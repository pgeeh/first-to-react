# JSX

React manages the creation, updating, and removal of HTML elements from the DOM. In order to accomplish this, either the `React.createElement` method or JSX can be used. 

JSX is an extesion of JavaScript which allows for including the HTML template inside of the same JavaScript file as the rest of the component logic.

JSX is not directly usable in the browser. It has to first be compiled from JSX into native JavaScript.

The use of JSX is not required to work with React, however there are many tools available which will transform the JSX during compilation, so JSX helps to keep source files readable. Many linters or source control tools can provide hints and warnings about JSX to enable faster and more efficient development.
