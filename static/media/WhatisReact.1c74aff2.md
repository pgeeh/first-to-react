## What is React?

“A JavaScript library for building user interfaces” - https://reactjs.org/

Combines stateful, efficient rendering and DOM management with declarative one-way data binding.

#### History

Originally created by Facebook, ReactJS eventually transitioned to [open source](https://github.com/facebook/react). It is one of the most commonly used user interface libraries, most commonly grouped with Angular and VueJS.

A rich ecosystem of libraries, frameworks, and tools have been built around and using React. Many of the most used websites in the world use React.

#### Basics

React manages the [DOM (document object model)](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Document_Object_Model) using components, which represent one or more native HTML elements. 

These components can be stand-alone, use provided information (called _props_), or manage their own stored information (called _state_). components can pass information down to child components.
