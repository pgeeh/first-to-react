# Getting Started Suggestions

In addition to the Concept Overviews and Examples later in this overview, there are many free and available tutorials for React, including the [official React Tutorial](https://reactjs.org/tutorial/tutorial.html) or [the React Docs](https://reactjs.org/docs/getting-started.html).

Ready to get started with your own project? Some suggestions:

* [create-react-app](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app) provides an easy, one-line command to bootstrap a new React project and get moving.

    * Other options are well documented on the documation page [Create a New React App](https://reactjs.org/docs/create-a-new-react-app.html)



* Use an IDE such as [VSCode](https://code.visualstudio.com/)

* Employ the use of ESLint and the VSCode ESLint extension. ESLint already comes configured with _create-react-app_-built applications, but can be extended.

* Check out the React Ecosystem pages again for popular libraries to enhance your app.
