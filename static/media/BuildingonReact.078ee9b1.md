# React Ecosystem

React has a very rich ecosystem, with many tools, frameworks, and extensions built by the community and companies alike.

__[NPM](https://www.npmjs.com/package/react)__ lists over 65,000 dependent projects.

React wrappers can be found for nearly any type of library, including pre-built UI components or drawing or maps. 

Some of the most commonly used and popular libraries will be explored on the next few pages.
