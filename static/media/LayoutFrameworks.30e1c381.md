# Layout Frameworks

React does not have built-in layout, theming, or style management. However, there are a large amount of libraries which make it easy to add these capabilities to a React application.

Two of these libraries are mentioned below, but there are many more.

__[Bootstrap](https://getbootstrap.com/)__ is one of the most widely used front-end toolkit for advanced UI components, styling, and layout. React wrappers such as [reactstrap](https://reactstrap.github.io/) and [react-bootstrap](https://react-bootstrap.github.io/) make it easy to add these pre-built components and layouts to your application.

__[Material-UI](https://material-ui.com/)__ is a React-specific library providing pre-built UI components, layouts, and theme management.

Both libraries provide:

* __Layout__ utilities which assist with creating responsive layouts
* __Form__ inputs which help style and manage simple to complex forms.
* __Modal__ management for popups

and much, much more.
