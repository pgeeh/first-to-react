## Components

Components each represent a single DOM element, which may or may not have DOM elements or additional Components as children.

#### Functional Components

Components based on a single function which returns the items to render.

Generally used for more basic components

#### Class Components

Expanded components with more access to the component lifecycle and state.

Examples:

Basic button

More advanced class which keeps state but updates if props change

There are new items called ‘Hooks’ added in a recent React update which allow more react features without needing the class structure, which simplifies another group of components just slightly too complex for a strictly functional component. Will go over these at the end.
