# ClassComponents

Class-based components extend `React.Component` and provide access to all of the [lifecyle methods](https://reactjs.org/docs/state-and-lifecycle.html).

Class Components can be useful as components get more complicated, but as the goal of React is to use more simpler Components, Functional Components are becoming much more common.

Class Components still have their place when complicate lifecyles come into play, as well as when a lot of state needs to be managed. React Hooks only go so far to replacing the class lifecycle methods.
