## What is React?

“A JavaScript library for building user interfaces” - https://reactjs.org/

Combines stateful, efficient rendering with declarative 1-way data binding.

### History

Originally created by Facebook, they eventually transition it to open source. Now one of the most commonly used User Interface frameworks, alongside Angular and VueJS.

### Benefits

__Component-Based__ - Build up complex UIs piece by piece, each component having a singular purpose.

__React Lifecycle__ - Manages _state_ and _props_ when components are added, updated, and removed in a consistent manner.

__Efficient__ - Using _state_ and _props_, alongside a virtual DOM, ensures that only changed components are re-rendered.

__Rich ecosystem__ - Many extensions and 3rd party libraries with React wrappers to enable many different pieces of functionality. Also possible to build native mobile apps using React Native.
