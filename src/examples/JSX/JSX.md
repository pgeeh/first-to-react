# JSX

JSX is an extesion of JavaScript which allows for including the HTML template inside of the same JavaScript file as the rest of the component logic.

The use of JSX is not required to work with React, however there are many tools available which will transform the JSX, so JSX helps to keep source files readable. Many linters or source control tools can provide hints and warnings about JSX.
