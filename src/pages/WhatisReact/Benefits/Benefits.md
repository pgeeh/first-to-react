## Benefits

__Small Set of Powerful Capabilities__ When compared to other UI View libraries, React has a relatively small set of features and concepts to understand.

__Easy to Learn__ - With a small set of set of capabilities, React can be learned relatively quickly. It does not require knowledge of the entire React capability set to get started, and complexity can be added over time.

__Reusable Components__ - Components can be reused in multiple places with varying _props_ to provide similar functionality and reduce duplication.

__Manages the DOM__ - React manages adding, updating, and removing Components from the web page so we do not have to.

__Efficient__ - Using _state_, _props_, and a virtual DOM, React ensures that expensive changes to the actual DOM are kept to a minimum. This means the application can scale well as data or complexity grows.

__Single Page Application Ready__ - Supports complex Single Page Applications by dynamic replacement of components.

__Rich Ecosystem__ - Many extensions and third party libraries have been ported with React wrappers to enable many different pieces of functionality to be added to an application in a consistent pattern.

__Many Resources and Trainings__ - React is a widely used product and benefits from a very large number of freely available resources and trainings.
