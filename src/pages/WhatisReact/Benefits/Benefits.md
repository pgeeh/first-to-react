## Benefits

__Small Set of Powerful Capabilities__ When compared to other UI View libraries, React has a relatively small set of features and concepts to understand. This allows components to be very simple display-only Components, or more advanced by managing information.

__Easy to Learn__ - React's small, but very powerful, set of capabilities means that it can be learned relatively quickly. It does not require knowledge of the entire React capablity set to get started and complexity can be added over time.

__Reuseable Components__ - Build up complex UIs piece by piece, each component having a singular purpose, and each component can be reused in different areas of the application.

<!-- __React Lifecycle__ - Manages _state_ and _props_ when components are added, updated, and removed in a consistent manner. -->

__Efficient__ - Using _state_, _props_, and a virtual DOM, ReactJS ensures that expensive changes to the actual DOM are kept to a minimum.

__Rich ecosystem__ - Many extensions and 3rd party libraries have been ported with React wrappers to enable many different pieces of functionality to be used in an application is a consistent pattern. More information later in React Ecosystem.

__Many Resources and Trainings__ - React is a widely used product and benefits from a very large number of freely available resources and trainings.
