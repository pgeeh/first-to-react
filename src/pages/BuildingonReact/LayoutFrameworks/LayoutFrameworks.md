# Layout Frameworks

React does not have included layout, theming, or style management. However, there are a large amount of libraries that make it easy to add these capabilities to a React application.

Two of these libraries are mentioned below, but there are many more.

__[Bootstrap](https://getbootstrap.com/)__ is one of the most widely used front-end toolkits for pre-built UI components, styling, and layout. React wrappers such as [reactstrap](https://reactstrap.github.io/) and [react-bootstrap](https://react-bootstrap.github.io/) make it easy to add these pre-built components and layouts to a React application.

__[Material-UI](https://material-ui.com/)__ is a React-specific library providing pre-built UI components, layouts, and theme management.

Both libraries provide:

* __Layout__ utilities that assist with creating responsive layouts
* __Form__ inputs that help style and manage simple to complex forms
* __Modal__ and __Toast__ management for pop-ups and notifications
* __Button__ and other interactive components like __Dropdown__ and __Nav__

and much, much more.
