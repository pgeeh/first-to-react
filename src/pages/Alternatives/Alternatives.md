# Alternatives

While ReactJS may be one of the most popular JavaScript UI libraries, there are others - along with plenty of discussions and comparisons to help understand their differences and different use cases. Some of the most popular (and similar) include:

__[Angular](https://angular.io/)__

> Angular is an application design framework and development platform for creating efficient and sophisticated single-page apps.

Angular is a revamped version of AngularJS. Originally made popular and used by Google, it is a popular framework for building applications and powers many of the largest and most used websites in the world.

__[Vue.js](https://vuejs.org/)__

> Vue (pronounced /vjuː/, like view) is a progressive framework for building user interfaces. Unlike other monolithic frameworks, Vue is designed from the ground up to be incrementally adoptable. The core library is focused on the view layer only, and is easy to pick up and integrate with other libraries or existing projects. On the other hand, Vue is also perfectly capable of powering sophisticated Single-Page Applications when used in combination with modern tooling and supporting libraries.

Vue.js is not necessarily a newcomer as it has been around since 2013, it has seen a surge in popularity over the past year or two.

__[Ember](https://emberjs.com/)__

> Ember.js is a productive, battle-tested JavaScript framework for building modern web applications. It includes everything you need to build rich UIs that work on any device.

Ember is a much more complete framework than React, with many additional features, components, and services included.

__[Backbone.js](http://backbonejs.org/)__

> Backbone.js gives structure to web applications by providing models with key-value binding and custom events, collections with a rich API of enumerable functions, views with declarative event handling, and connects it all to your existing API over a RESTful JSON interface.

Backbone.js is another more complete MVC framework, similar to Ember and Angular.
