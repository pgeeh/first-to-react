# JSX

React manages the creation, updating, and removal of HTML elements from the web page. In order to accomplish this, either the `React.createElement` method or JSX can be used. 

JSX is an extension of JavaScript that allows for including the HTML template inside of the same JavaScript file as the rest of the component logic.

JSX is not directly usable in the browser. It has to first be compiled from JSX into native JavaScript.

The use of JSX is not required to work with React, however there are many tools available that will transform the JSX during compilation, so JSX helps to keep source files readable. Many linters or source control tools can provide hints and warnings about JSX to enable faster and more efficient development.

##### __Examples__:

__Basic JSX__ shows the basic markup for JSX.

_Note: All JSX markup should be surrounded by parentheses `()` as a best practice, although it is not required in all situations._

__Inline JS__ shows how to use JavaScript inline with JSX by surrounding the JavaScript with curly braces `{}`.

__No JSX__ shows the previous example using `React.createElement`.
